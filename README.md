# Punching Speed App - Shadow Boxing

## Overview

"Punching Speed App" is an interactive mobile application that measures the speed of your punch using the phone's accelerometer. By tracking your punch speed, the app provides users with feedback on their performance, comparing it to the punching power of legendary boxers like Mike Tyson. This app offers an engaging and fun way to track and improve your punch speed while offering a lighthearted comparison to world-class athletes.

## Portfolio Project

This app was developed as a personal portfolio project to showcase skills in building interactive mobile applications using React Native and Expo. The app demonstrates real-time sensor data handling with the phoneâ€™s accelerometer and provides users with an entertaining way to measure their physical performance.

## Features

- **Punch Speed Tracking**: Measure the speed of your punch in meters per second (m/s) using your phone's accelerometer.
- **Live Feedback**: Receive real-time feedback on your maximum punch speed during each attempt.
- **Comparison to Mike Tyson's Punch Speed**: After each attempt, compare your speed to the legendary punch of Mike Tyson.
- **Simple User Interface**: Enjoy an easy-to-navigate interface that gives clear instructions and displays results in a user-friendly manner.
- **Instructional Flow**: Follow clear steps to perform the perfect shadow punch, with a 2-3 second countdown before measuring the speed.
- **Real-Time Results**: After each attempt, get an instant result showing your maximum punch speed, followed by a fun comparison to Mike Tyson's punch speed.

## Technology Stack
